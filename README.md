# AI Maze Solver

This project implements and compares different algorithms for maze solving, including brute force methods and AI heuristic techniques. It also provides a visual representation of the maze-solving process using Pygame.

## Features

- Maze generation using random functions with constraints to ensure solvability
- Implementation of multiple maze-solving algorithms:
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - A* algorithm with Manhattan heuristic
  - A* algorithm with Euclidean heuristic
- Pygame GUI for visualizing the maze-solving process
- Performance comparison between different algorithms

## Algorithms

### Breadth First Search (BFS)
A brute force algorithm that explores all possible paths from the start node to the end node, expanding nodes level by level. It guarantees the shortest path but can be computationally expensive for larger mazes.

### Depth First Search (DFS)
Another brute force algorithm that traverses the maze depth-first, exploring each path as far as possible before backtracking. It's not guaranteed to find the shortest path but can be more efficient for larger mazes.

### A* Algorithm
An informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide its search towards the goal node. We implement A* with two heuristics:
- Manhattan distance
- Euclidean distance

## Visualization

The project includes a Pygame GUI that visualizes the maze-solving process, showing:
- The initial unsolved maze
- The exploration process of the chosen algorithm
- The final solved path
